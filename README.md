# Indian Coin Count Detection

This project aims to detect and count Indian coins using computer vision techniques. The system processes an image of Indian coins, detects the coins, and identifies their denomination. The project uses image processing algorithms to accurately detect and classify coins such as ₹1, ₹2, ₹5, ₹10, and others.

## Features

- **Coin Detection**: Detects coins in a given image using image processing techniques.
- **Denomination Recognition**: Identifies different denominations of Indian coins (₹1, ₹2, ₹5, ₹10).
- **Count Calculation**: Automatically counts the number of coins for each denomination in the image.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Upload an image for coin detection and get the result instantly.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: For image processing and coin detection.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the implementation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (optional, if used): For deep learning-based classification (if applicable).
